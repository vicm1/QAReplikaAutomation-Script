### CMPE 187

## Overview
This is an automation test script for my group project for CMPE 187, this is only my part of the script. The deliverables go into more detail about the project.
##### Goal:
Replika is a chatbot app that a user can utilize as their own personal companion. It can develop its own personality and teach it new things. The chatbot can be played games with and much more. 
The chatbot has features for managing the user's anxiety and depression. After all, Replika isn’t just a companion, it can also track the user’s mood and understand their 
thoughts/feelings with daily conversations. This bot learns on the go about the user. To see how well it can keep the information that the user has inputted. We looked into both short-term and long-term memory. 
Short-term memory is to see if the chatbot remembers ongoing chat sessions while long-term memory is to see how well it remembers past chat sessions. With the test automation script, I tested the chatbot's long-term memory by asking it Q&A, using
previous chat sessions to see if they remember past user questions or answers.
